              <h3 align="center">History</h3>

              <p align="justify">
                Noise-Planet is a platform bringing together the results of research collaborations carried out by acousticians from Université Gustave Eiffel (formerly Ifsttar) and geographers-geomaticians from CNRS on the issue of environmental noise assessment. This collaboration has made it possible to implement IT tools, combining "geomatics" and "acoustics", freely distributed in Open Source to different communities.
              </p>

              <h3 align="center">Objectives</h3>

              <p align="justify">
                The objective of the Noise-Planet project (subsequently simply "Noise-Planet" or "Project") is to develop, disseminate and promote free scientific tools for the assessment of environmental noise, at the interface between acoustics and geographic information science, within the framework of Open Science (Open Source, Open Data, Open standard, ...).
                <br>
                These tools are intended for a large community, both public and private, and in particular:
                <ul>
                  <li>academic world (teachers and students),</li>
                  <li>researchers (public or private),</li>
                  <li>professional community of environmental acousticians.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <h3 align="center">General operating principle</h3>

              <p align="justify">
                The Noise-Planet project is managed by a Steering Committee, which can rely on an Advisory Board and Technical Committees.
                <br>
                These bodies, whose lists of Members are public, are composed of individual or institutional, voluntary Members who contribute, at different levels, to the development and/or enhancement of the Project. By participating in the Noise-Planet project, a Member commits itself.
                <br>
                Individual or institutional Contributors may also, at their own initiative, participate in the project, without being a Member, using the development resources made available to them by the Project. All Contributors are listed in a public List of Contributors.

              <h3 align="center">Missions</h3>

              <p align="justify">
                The Steering Committee ("SC") is the steering body of Noise-Planet. Its missions are as follows:
                <ul>
                  <li>The SC ensures the complete management of the components, projects and instances of Noise-Planet.</li>
                  <li>The SC examines applications for membership, renewal and exclusion of members from the Noise-Planet bodies.</li>
                  <li>The SC examines requests for contributions from Contributors to the Project.</li>
                  <li>The SC manages all the tools and platforms necessary for the management of the Project, as well as for the development and dissemination of the Components.</li>
                  <li>The SC ensures that there is no conflict of interest or, where applicable, addresses any conflict of interest that may arise within the Project.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <h3 align="center">Composition</h3>

              <p align="justify">
              	When the Noise-Planet project was created, the SC was composed of:
                <ul>
                  <li>two co-Presidents (Université Gustave Eiffel (formerly Ifsttar) & CNRS),</li>
                  <li>a Vice President in charge of IT developments,</li>
                  <li>a Vice-President in charge of communication.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
              	The co-Presidents, each representing a founding organization of Noise-Planet:
                <ul>
                  <li>ensure a collegial management of the Project,</li>
                  <li>undertake to respect the interests of their respective home organizations,</li>
                  <li>undertake to ensure all useful communication with their respective home organization.</li>
                </ul>
    			<br>
              	All SC Members undertake to respect the common rules for a Member's engagement in the project.
              </p>

              <h3 align="center">How it works</h3>

              <p align="justify">
                <ul>
                  <li>The SC meets regularly, either physically or through remote communication tools, at least once a year.</li>
                  <li>Meetings are organized at the request of one of the SC Members.</li>
                  <li>The meetings are facilitated by one of the co-President.</li>
                  <li>Decisions are taken by a three-quarters majority of the Members.</li>
                  <li>Members concerned by the said discussion in the event of any conflict of interest shall be excluded from discussions on decisions.</li>
                  <li>Each SC meeting is reported.</li>

                <ul>

                  <li>In the event of a serious disagreement between the co-Presidents, and provided that the conflict cannot be resolved by an ad hoc body, the Project shall be dissolved.</li>
                  <li>In the event of dissolution of the Project, the bodies of the co-Presidents agree on a distribution of the Common Properties.</li>
                </ul>

              <h3 align="center">Renewal of the SC</h3>

              <p align="justify">
                The SC is intended to exist and function as long as the Noise-Planet project exists. It is tacitly renewed on 1 January of each year.
              </p>

              <h3 align="center">Entry of a new Member</h3>

              <p align="justify">
                The SC may propose to integrate a new Member.
              </p>

              <h3 align="center">Removal of a member</h3>

              <p align="justify">
                Upon written request to the SC, a Member (or its parent body) may unilaterally request its withdrawal from the SC. The outgoing Party may:
                <ul>
                  <li>transfer the entirety of its Property to another Member providing co-Direction (resulting in a change in the composition of the SC),</li>
                  <li>transfer the management of its Property to another Member providing co-Direction (resulting in a change in the composition of the SC),</li>
                  <li>propose to another body to become a Member of the SC and appoint a new co-Director to represent it in the SC (resulting in a change in the composition of the SC).</li>
                </ul>
            	The choice of one of these options must be validated by the other co-Presidents.
              </p>

              <h3 align="center">Conflict management</h3>

              <p align="justify">
                In the event of conflicts between the co-Presidents that cannot be resolved within the SC, the General Directorates of the respective bodies of the co-Presidents are requested. By mutual agreement, they set up a body to help resolve the conflict.

                The List of Contributors ("LC") includes all persons who contribute or have actively contributed to Noise-Planet or to one of its components.

              <h3 align="center">Composition</h3>

              <p align="justify">
                Integration into the LC is free and open to anyone:
                <ul>
                  <li>having</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>carried out intellectual work, over a verifiable period of more than 2 months, for the benefit of Noise-Planet or one of its components</li>
                    <li>or made a significant and verifiable contribution to some of the following actions (non-exhaustive list):</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Programming</li>
                      <li>Development management</li>
                      <li>Translation</li>

                  </ul>
                  <li>having confirmed its registration in the LC, validated by the SC,</li>
                  <li>agreeing to have their full name and, if applicable, their organization/company posted on a public list,</li>
                  <li>where applicable, in the case of a person who has contributed on behalf of an organization/company, ensuring the agreement of his organization/company sharing the Noise-Planet philosophy, in accordance with the rules of courtesy and ethics.</li>
                </ul>

                Registration with LC may be lost:
                <ul>
                  <li>following a decision by the Contributor in question to leave the LC, without having to justify itself,</li>
                  <li>following a decision of the SC, if the behaviour of the Member in question is contrary to the philosophy of Noise-Planet.</li>

              <h3 align="center">How it works</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>A LC is produced for each project or component.</li>
                  <li>A person can be part of several LCs at the same time.</li>
