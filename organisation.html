              <h3 align="center">History</h3>
              
              <p align="justify">
                Noise-Planet is a platform bringing together the results of research collaborations carried out by acousticians from Université Gustave Eiffel (formerly Ifsttar) and geographers-geomaticians from CNRS on the issue of environmental noise assessment. This collaboration has made it possible to implement IT tools, combining "geomatics" and "acoustics", freely distributed in Open Source to different communities.
              </p>

              <h3 align="center">Objectives</h3>

              <p align="justify">
                The objective of the Noise-Planet project (subsequently simply "Noise-Planet" or "Project") is to develop, disseminate and promote free scientific tools for the assessment of environmental noise, at the interface between acoustics and geographic information science, within the framework of Open Science (Open Source, Open Data, Open standard, ...). 
                <br>
                These tools are intended for a large community, both public and private, and in particular:
                <ul>
                  <li>academic world (teachers and students),</li>
                  <li>researchers (public or private),</li>
                  <li>professional community of environmental acousticians.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <h3 align="center">General operating principle</h3>

              <p align="justify">
                The Noise-Planet project is managed by a Steering Committee, which can rely on an Advisory Board and Technical Committees.
                <br>
                These bodies, whose lists of Members are public, are composed of individual or institutional, voluntary Members who contribute, at different levels, to the development and/or enhancement of the Project. By participating in the Noise-Planet project, a Member commits itself.
                <br>
                Individual or institutional Contributors may also, at their own initiative, participate in the project, without being a Member, using the development resources made available to them by the Project. All Contributors are listed in a public List of Contributors.

              <p align="justify">
                Integration into the LC is free and open to anyone:
                <ul>
                  <li>having</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>carried out intellectual work, over a verifiable period of more than 2 months, for the benefit of Noise-Planet or one of its components</li>
                    <li>or made a significant and verifiable contribution to some of the following actions (non-exhaustive list):</li>

                  <li>having confirmed its registration in the LC, validated by the SC,</li>
                  <li>agreeing to have their full name and, if applicable, their organization/company posted on a public list,</li>
                  <li>where applicable, in the case of a person who has contributed on behalf of an organization/company, ensuring the agreement of his organization/company sharing the Noise-Planet philosophy, in accordance with the rules of courtesy and ethics.</li>
                </ul>

                Registration with LC may be lost:
                <ul>
                  <li>following a decision by the Contributor in question to leave the LC, without having to justify itself,</li>
                  <li>following a decision of the SC, if the behaviour of the Member in question is contrary to the philosophy of Noise-Planet.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>A LC is produced for each project or component.</li>
                  <li>A person can be part of several LCs at the same time.</li>
